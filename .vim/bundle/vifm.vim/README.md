vifm.vim
========

This is a mirror of the vifm.vim plugin (authored by [K.Steen](https://github.com/ksteen) and [Xaizek](https://github.com/xaizek)) to allow installation via [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle). Vifm.vim is a tiny extension to Vim that helps leveraging the excellent [vifm file manager](http://vifm.sourceforge.net/) as a file picker from within vim.

A few predefined commands are implemented. More can be added very easily.

    :EditVifm - open file in current buffer.

    :SplitVifm - split buffer and open file.

    :VsplitVifm - vertically split buffer and open file.

    :TabVifm - load file in new tab.

    :DiffVifm - load file for :vert diffsplit.
